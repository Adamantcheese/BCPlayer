x javafx media/mediaplayer
x jsoup

ALGORITHM FOR PLAYING A RANDOM SONG:
take csv and make string array
grab a random item from the array
use jsoup to grab the page
grab all the stuff tagged as "mp3-128"
grab a random one from that set of mp3's
play that mp3

include start/pause/play buttons
include a skip button
display metadata if there is any (album cover/artist(s)/playtime)
keep track of what point in the buffer the user quits, and save that to a file

CATCH (BE VERBOSE)
-----------------------
x 404 exception - skip that when trying to get songs
x no songs on the album page - skip that when trying to get songs

WARN
-----------------------
x large song - send to console a message saying that the song may take a while to load (or warn user)
  RESOLVED - skip songs that are >10MB


TODO: Add in URL expansion for URLs that contain multiple album/track links on one page.
    REGEX: (<a href=\"/album/.*?\">|<a href=\"/track/.*?\">)*?
TODO: Make song downloads run in their own threads so that the window doesn't display "Not Responding" when downloading a song.
